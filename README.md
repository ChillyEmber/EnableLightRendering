# EnableLightRendering
Enables Light Rendering for SCP:SL on 10.0.0
To use just open the .exe, and it will toggle the Light Rendering.
Currently fixed in one of the latest updates, thus, this program won't be updated, however, if a new issue arises, with Light Rendering, I'll go ahead and slap in a update to fix that!
