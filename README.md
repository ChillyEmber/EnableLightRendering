# EnableLightRendering
Enables Light Rendering for SCP:SL on 10.0.0
To use just open the .exe, and it will toggle the Light Rendering.
Currently fixed in one of the latest updates, thus, this program is archived. The program, will probably remain archived, unless the issue pops up again, thus I'll update the program to fix it.
